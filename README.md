STORE:

- The State tree
- A way to get state out of the store.
- A way to listen for state changes.
- A way to update the state.

The idea behind Redux or state management libraries like redux
is to centralize the state in order to make the application behavior
predictable and restrict the ways in which state can be modified.
They acheive by promoting a centralized global state object, modifieble through a
fixed set of APIs, instead of state being spread throught the application
with no fixed APIs to modify them.
